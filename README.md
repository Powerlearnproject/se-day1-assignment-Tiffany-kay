# Software Engineering Day 1 Assignment  

## Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering  

### 1. What is Software Engineering?  
Software engineering is the process of designing, building, testing, and maintaining software. It ensures software is reliable, efficient, and meets user needs.  

### 2. Key Milestones in the Evolution of Software Engineering  
- **1950s - High-Level Programming Languages:** Made coding simpler and faster.  
- **1970s - Structured Programming:** Organized code to reduce errors.  
- **2001 - Agile Manifesto:** Improved teamwork and feedback in software development.  

### 3. Phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)  
- **Planning:** Decide what the software should do.  
- **Design:** Create a blueprint for the system.  
- **Development:** Write and create the code.  
- **Testing:** Check for errors and bugs.  
- **Deployment:** Release the software for users.  
- **Maintenance:** Update and fix issues after release.  

### 4. Waterfall vs. Agile Methodologies  
- **Waterfall:** Step-by-step process where each phase is completed before moving to the next.  
  - *Example:* Payroll system development.  
- **Agile:** Work is divided into smaller parts (sprints) with regular feedback.  
  - *Example:* Food delivery app development.  

### 5. Roles in a Software Engineering Team  
- **Software Developer:** Writes and fixes code.  
- **Quality Assurance Engineer:** Tests software for bugs.  
- **Project Manager:** Manages timelines, resources, and team coordination.  

### 6. Importance of IDEs and VCS  
- **IDEs (Integrated Development Environments):** Tools like PyCharm and Visual Studio make coding and testing faster.  
- **VCS (Version Control Systems):** Tools like Git and GitHub track changes and improve teamwork.  

### 7. Challenges in Software Engineering and Solutions  
- **Tight Deadlines:** Break tasks into smaller goals and focus on priorities.  
- **Complex Bugs:** Use debugging tools and seek help online.  
- **Learning New Tools:** Practice and take tutorials regularly.  

### 8. Types of Testing  
- **Unit Testing:** Checks small parts of the code.  
- **Integration Testing:** Ensures different parts of the software work together.  
- **System Testing:** Tests the complete application.  
- **Acceptance Testing:** Confirms the software meets user needs.

## Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering  

### 1. What is Prompt Engineering?  
Prompt engineering is the skill of writing clear and detailed instructions for AI. It helps AI give better and more accurate responses.  

### 2. Example of a Prompt Improvement  
- **Vague Prompt:** "Tell me about science."  
- **Improved Prompt:** "Explain the difference between renewable and non-renewable energy sources in three sentences."  
- **Why itâ€™s better:** It specifies the topic (energy sources) and gives a clear limit (three sentences), ensuring focus and relevance.
